# Home

Welcome to the blog.

My name is Daniel Limanowski, and I enjoy networking (the technical and meeting new people kind!), offensive security, programming, and automation.

I'm also big on [entrepreneurship](https://relatrace.com) and think sales and marketing are (almost) as exciting as tech.
