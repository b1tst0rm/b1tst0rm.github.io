I've attempted the Holiday Hack Challenge in past years but never put in enough
time nor effort to actually finish all the challenges. One benefit from this
global pandemic was that I found myself with more time at home this usual, so I
figured I'd pour it into a goal to finally make it through the Holiday Hack
Challenge.

The below link is a playlist with video solutions for every terminal, game,
and objective for this competition. I chose a video "writeup" over a tradional
writeup to provide extra context and explain _how_ I approach solving these
challenges to hopefully help others. Rather than present answers directly, I wanted
to provide an outlet for _teaching_ how to solve the challenges.

I hope someone finds it useful :)
